## 1. Content brief for a target keyword

**When to use:** You have a keyword and need a one-page brief before writing or briefing a writer.

**Paste this, then replace [KEYWORD] and optionally [URL]:**

```
You are an SEO content strategist. Create a one-page content brief for this keyword.

Target keyword: [KEYWORD]
Existing URL (if optimizing): [URL] (or "new page")

Output in this structure:
1. **Primary keyword** — exact phrase and close variants to include.
2. **Search intent** — What the user wants (informational/commercial/transactional). One sentence.
3. **Suggested H2s** — 4–6 H2 headings that match intent and common SERP results.
4. **Word count range** — Based on what ranks.
5. **Key entities/topics** — Concepts to cover for E-E-A and topical depth.
6. **One CTA** — Single clear next step for the reader.
```

## 2. On-page optimization checklist

**When to use:** You have a live page and want a concrete optimization checklist.

**Paste this, then replace [URL]:**

```
You are an SEO specialist. For this URL, produce an on-page optimization checklist.

URL: [URL]

Assume I will check the live SERP myself. Output:
1. **Target query** — The one search phrase this page should clearly target.
2. **Title tag** — Suggested title (with primary keyword near the front), max ~60 chars.
3. **Meta description** — One suggestion, max ~155 chars.
4. **H1** — Is the current H1 aligned? If not, suggest one.
5. **H2/H3 structure** — Bullet list of recommended headings (or changes to existing).
6. **Top 3 on-page actions** — Numbered. Each = one concrete change (e.g. add a definition, add a comparison table, fix internal link). No vague advice.
